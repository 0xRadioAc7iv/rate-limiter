This guide will help you quickly set up and integrate rate limiting into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm**, **pnpm** or **yarn** installed

## Installation

You can install the library using either npm or yarn:

```sh
# Using npm
npm i @radioac7iv/rate-limiter
```

```sh
# Using pnpm
pnpm i @radioac7iv/rate-limiter
```

```sh
# Using yarn
yarn add @radioac7iv/rate-limiter
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js 14+ installed.
- If using Redis for distributed rate limiting you'll need to install and configure a redis client as well. Click **[here](./configuration/storage.mdx#redis)** to see how to use Redis with this package.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the rate limiter in an **Express.js** application:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { expressRateLimiter } from "@radioac7iv/rate-limiter";

const app = express();

const rateLimit = expressRateLimiter({
  limitOptions: () => {
    return { max: 5, window: 10 };
  },
});

app.use(rateLimit);

app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.status(200).send({ message: "Hello!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started at PORT: 3000");
});
```

## Next Steps

- Configure custom storage options in **[Storage Configuration](./configuration/storage.mdx)**
