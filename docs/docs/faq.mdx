### **1. How do I apply rate limiting to specific routes?**

You can apply the middleware to individual routes:

```javascript
app.post(
  "/auth/reset-password",
  expressRateLimiter({
    limitOptions: () => {
      return { max: 2, window: 3600 };
    },
  })
);
```

### **2. Can I set different rate limits for different users?**

Yes, you can use dynamic rate limits based on user roles or API keys.

```javascript
app.post(
  "/upload",
  expressRateLimiter({
    limitOptions: (req) => {
      if (req.user.isPremium === true) return { max: 100, window: 3600 };
      else return { max: 50, window: 3600 };
    },
  })
);
```

### **3. Does this library support distributed rate limiting?**

Yes, when using Redis as the storage backend, rate limits are shared across multiple servers.

### **4. How can I allow certain IPs to bypass rate limits?**

You can whitelist IPs:

```javascript
app.use(expressRateLimiter({
  key: (req) => req.ip as string,
  skip: ["ip-1", "ip-2"],
  limitOptions: () => {
    return { max: 5, window: 10 };
  }
}));
```

### **5. What happens when a request exceeds the limit?**

The middleware returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### **6: Why does it not work with NestJS with Fastify?**

Ensure that you have configured NestJS to use Fastify as the underlying HTTP Adapter and try again.
